Project Description:
This is a project about the works of Jane Austen, a female novelist recognized for her critique of 18th century British gentry culture and society. My aim is to conduct text analysis regarding the eight published books from Austen, and answer the question of what unique writing style or characteristic does Jane Austen employ in her writings? The nature of my project requires the use of text files and metadata of the novelist' original work, followed by text analysis and data visualization using python.

The Github repository includes the following contents:
* Jane_Austen.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis, visualizations, and research findings.
* README.md: this is what you are currently viewing, includes project description and how to navigate the repository
* classics.csv: the original dataset obtained from CORGIS, include information about the top 1000 most popular books on Project Gutenberg
* requirements.txt: text file containing all pacakages and libraries in this project

All materials are public. Below is the link to the project blog:
