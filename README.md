Project Description:
This is a project about the works of Jane Austen, a female novelist recognized for her critique of 18th century British gentry culture and society. My aim is to conduct text analysis regarding the eight published books from Austen, and answer the question of what unique writing style or characteristic does Jane Austen employ in her writings? The nature of my project requires the use of text files and metadata of the novelist' original work, followed by text analysis and data visualization using python.
